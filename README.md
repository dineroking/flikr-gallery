rp16 Ronny Michael Leland project

Initial conversation about our rp16 project.

// look at github for file management
// single page website written in javascript
// with a css style sheet
// that uses ajax/json to make updates based on user interaction
// contains pictures of cats and dogs that are called via api request from flikr (https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
// displays first images in a small gallery
// image size increases on hover
// image opens to cover screen on click (layering)
// images have info and/or link for additional photos of same animal
// 
// build html bare bones site to start
//
